# 📧 Email Spam Detection System
An AI-based solution to classify and filter spam emails using machine learning algorithms. This project was developed during the **AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham**.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
The **Email Spam Detection System** uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to identify spam and legitimate emails. The goal is to enhance email security by accurately flagging spam content while minimizing false positives.

---

## 🔥 **Features**
- 📊 **Spam Classification:** Detects spam emails using ML algorithms.
- ⚙️ **Model Evaluation:** Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for performance assessment.
- 🔍 **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Text cleaning (removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuations)
  - Tokenization and vectorization using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- 📈 **Visualization:** 
  - Displays spam vs. ham distribution.
  - Shows model performance through graphs.

## ⚙️ **Technologies Used**
- 🐍 **Python**
- 💡 **Scikit-Learn** (for ML model training and evaluation)
- 🔎 **Numpy & Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis)
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- 🔥 **Jupyter Notebook**
